## Current Objective

Close R6E-C5 after the verified local FastMCP READ registration
of `search_policy_documents`.

The production FastMCP stdio server now registers the existing
policy-search composition with `ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=True)`.
Production `list_tools()` discovery preserves the frozen input
contract: required `query` and optional integer `k` with default 5.

Registration and discovery are verified locally. Publication remains
pending until the C5 implementation, tests, and governance updates are
committed, pushed, and synchronization is confirmed.

G3 is advanced but not complete. Live MCP `call_tool()` execution,
the remaining MCP tools, and later agent-through-MCP execution remain
pending.

## CP7 Embedding Completion

### Model contract

- Embedding model: `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
- Embedding dimension: 384
- Model context length: 512 tokens
- Default embedding batch size: 32
- Local inference via `sentence-transformers`
- Document embeddings are normalized
- Query embeddings use the BGE retrieval instruction
- Model loading is lazy and cached per Python process

### Canonical corpus validation

- Canonical chunks: 400
- Unique chunk IDs: 400
- Duplicate chunk IDs: 0
- Invalid chunk texts: 0
- Invalid token counts: 0
- Maximum real-corpus chunk length: 141 tokens
- Full embedding matrix: `(400, 384)`
- Embedding dtype: `float32`
- Non-finite embedding values: 0
- All corpus embeddings normalized: pass
- Canonical chunk-to-row association: pass
- First real chunk repeatability: pass
- Batch-size stability (16 vs 32): pass

### Numerical-stability evidence

Verified on:

- device: Apple MPS
- PyTorch: 2.13.0
- sentence-transformers: 5.6.1
- NumPy: 2.4.6

Acceptance tolerance:

- `rtol=1e-5`
- `atol=1e-5`

Results:

- repeated document embeddings: pass
- repeated query embeddings: pass
- ordering stability: pass
- batch-size invariance: pass
- maximum observed full-corpus batch difference: 0.0
- maximum observed first-chunk repeat difference:
  `1.1920928955078125e-07`

Cross-device or cross-platform byte-identical floating-point
results are not claimed.

### Performance evidence

Observed full-corpus embedding runs:

- 400 chunks in 7.256 seconds
- 400 chunks in 6.376 seconds
- measured throughput: approximately 62.73 chunks/second
- embedding matrix size: 614,400 bytes (~0.586 MiB)

These are observed local measurements, not performance
guarantees.

### Verification

- Focused embedding tests: 67 passed
- Full repository regression: 268 passed
- `git diff --check`: pass
- Working tree after CP7 validation: clean

### CP7 commits

- `e9ee1c2` — `feat(rag): add embedding model lifecycle`
- `508f9bc` — `feat(rag): add document embedding`
- `a872eac` — `feat(rag): add query embedding`

E4 numerical stability and E5 full-corpus validation required no
production-code changes and therefore no artificial commits were
created.

## S5 MCP Progress — 2026-08-18

### Verified milestones

- `93d226d` — `deps: add official MCP SDK`
  - pinned `mcp==1.29.0` and required transitive dependencies;
  - `pip check`: pass;
  - FastMCP, stdio, ToolAnnotations and `readOnlyHint` API verified.
- `3e1177a` — `feat(mcp): add stdio server foundation`
  - one FastMCP server;
  - explicit V1 `stdio` transport;
  - local `mcp/` remains non-package to avoid SDK shadowing.
- `a4ab00b` — `feat(mcp): add policy retrieval adapter foundation`
  - repository-root runtime bootstrap verified;
  - pure `RetrievalResult` to MCP response projection;
  - exact five-field schema: `doc_id`, `title`, `section`,
    `snippet`, `score`.
- `c0e3759` — `feat(mcp): add policy search composition`
  - `search_policy_documents(query, k=5)` implemented;
  - delegates validation/retrieval to `rag.retrieve`;
  - preserves retrieval ordering and similarity score;
  - lower-layer errors propagate unchanged.

### Verification evidence

- Active Chroma collection: `policy_chunks`, 400 records.
- Focused MCP suite: 21 passed.
- Full repository regression: 936 passed.
- `git diff --check`: pass before C4 commit.
- WF1 real-corpus search:
  - `HR-POL-004` Remote and Flexible Work Policy in top 5;
  - `HR-POL-005` Information Security and Acceptable Use Policy
    in top 5.
- WF2 real-corpus search:
  - `HR-POL-002` Paid Time Off Policy at ranks 1, 2, and 4.
- R6E-C5 local verification:
  - production `search_policy_documents` registration: pass;
  - `ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=True)`: pass;
  - production `list_tools()` discovery: exactly one tool;
  - discovered `query`: required string;
  - discovered `k`: optional integer with default 5;
  - focused registration/discovery tests: 4 passed;
  - complete MCP suite: 24 passed;
  - full repository regression: 984 passed;
  - `pip check`: pass;
  - `git diff --check`: pass.
- G3 status: advanced, not complete.
  - Python MCP-facing composition, FastMCP registration, and
    discovery are verified.
  - Live MCP invocation and agent-through-MCP execution remain
    pending.

## Current Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Stale or partially published Chroma index | medium | inspect persistence semantics before publication; validate temporary index before publishing |
| Index metadata mismatch | medium | compare corpus version and embedding/chunk configuration before reuse |
| Retrieval misses workflow-critical rules | medium | known-question and WF1/WF2 retrieval validation |
| Similarity threshold poorly calibrated | medium | inspect score distribution during retrieval evaluation |
| Model unavailable on fresh deployment | low-medium | deployment build pre-downloads frozen embedding model |

## Blockers

None.

## Next Action

Close and publish R6E-C5:

1. update `ai-tooling.md` with the verified C5 implementation session;
2. review the complete C5 code, tests, and governance diff;
3. run final hygiene checks;
4. commit the coherent R6E-C5 change set;
5. push to `origin/main`;
6. verify `HEAD`, `main`, `origin/main`, and `origin/HEAD` are synchronized;
7. only then advance the project status to the next MCP checkpoint.

Do not begin live MCP `call_tool()` or agent integration until
R6E-C5 is committed, pushed, and synchronization is verified.
